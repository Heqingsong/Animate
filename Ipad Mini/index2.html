              A unique course in the field of theatre and performance practice,
              this one-year MA course allows students with a strong,
              demonstrable background in performance to re-examine and broaden
              their skills in a truly experimental and highly collaborative
              framework.
            </p>

            <p class="content-block__text">
              The emphasis throughout the year is on devised and ensemble work,
              as you will advance your understanding of performance from a
              post-Stanislavski standpoint.
            </p>

            <p class="content-block__text">
              The course, validated by Kingâ€™s College London, one of the
              worldâ€™s top 20 universities, explores non-mainstream theatre
              craft internationally. Read about some of graduates in the

              The course is built around three strands:
            </p>

            <p class="content-block__text">
              Acting and Performance: Practice and Methodology - Working from
              the foundation of the Stanislavski â€˜systemâ€™, you will be
              introduced to the approaches and responses of later practitioners,
              including Brecht, Copeau, Meyerhold, and Grotowski. International
              historical context is given through exploring the improvisational
              and physical practice, developments in experimental theatre
              internationally, new writing, and performance since the early 20th
              Century. Development of Performance - This dual aspect of the
              course builds on your strengths and skills, whilst improving areas
              where you are less experienced. The first strand supports you as
              you refine and improve your understanding of how to develop as an
              individual within an ensemble environment. The second covers vocal
              and physical performance training, supplemented by Commedia,
              creative writing, improvisation, and singing. Scene Study - Scene
              study is woven throughout the course and provides a forum for you
              to develop and experiment with the techniques you are learning.
